# Hans Wehr Android App

This is a mostly functional app for the Hans Wehr dictionary that will no longer be developed on. The column feature does not work. However, I'll inshaAllah be developing a new one in the new future. This app requires an internet connection, but in the new re-built one, it hopefully will not require an internet connection with it being fully functional. 

This is thanks to the [Ejtaal](https://ejtaal.net) website's Arabic Almanac which was developed by https://github.com/ejtaal.
